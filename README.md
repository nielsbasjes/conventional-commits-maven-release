# What is this?
This is a Version Policy (_next version calculator_) for the [maven-release-plugin](https://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/) that follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) model.

So the scm tags and commit messages are automatically used to determine the next version number of your project.

The documentation can be found here: https://maven.basjes.nl
